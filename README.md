# Crunch Accounting Coding Challenge

## Overview

As part of the interview process, I have been asked to undertake a coding challenge. The challenge entails creating a form in React.js for an accountant. The accountant will be able to fill in the form and, if all required fields are filled and valid, can click 'save' and see their submitted form. If they wish to cancel their form, they can click 'cancel' which will reset all fields.

## Instructions To Run

## Instructions To Build

Once you have cloned the repository and installed the dependencies, you can build the application and prepare for production and deployment.
