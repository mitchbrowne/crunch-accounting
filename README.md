# Crunch Accounting Coding Challenge

## Overview

As part of the interview process, I have been asked to undertake a coding challenge. The challenge entails creating a form in React.js for an accountant. The accountant will be able to fill in the form and, if all required fields are filled and valid, can click save and see their submitted form.

## Instructions To Run

To run the app, follow the instructions below.

### Clone Repo

You must first access this repository on your local by cloning the repository. To do this, see the following instructions:

To ensure you have all the required dependencies for this application, navigate to the project directory and run ```npm install```.

Once all the dependencies have successfully installed, you can now run the following command while in the project directory:

This will run the app in the development mode.<br />
